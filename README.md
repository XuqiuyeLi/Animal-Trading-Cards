# Animal-Trading-Cards
This project is the first project of Front-end developer nano-degree by Udacity. The requirement is to make a page that resembles card from design prototype using HTML and CSS.

## How to run
1. Download both the **card.html** and **style.css**
2. Open the html file on browser

## Usage
1. Open card.html and replace the image and information with your favorite animal's image and information. For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Also, don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="panda" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.

2. Once you've added your favorite animal's image and information, add the proper CSS to styles.css of your preference. Youâ€™ll need to modify card.html to include attributes and use selectors to specify the elements you want to style. Also, make sure to link to your stylesheet in card.html or else your CSS will not be applied to your webpage.


**Enjoy the cute panda!**
